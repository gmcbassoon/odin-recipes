    <h1><strong>Baked Potatoes!</strong></h1>
        <p>Here are the ingredients we will be using for our recipe today!
            <ul>
                <li>4 <em>Large</em> baking potatoes</li>
                <li>8 Slices of bacon</li>
                <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                <li>8 green onions, sliced <strong>AND</strong> diced</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These are the tools we will be using.
            <ul>
                <li>Baking sheet</li>
                <li>Large, deep skillet</li>
                <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
                <li>Hand Mixer</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Next, we will need to gather the will power to do the rest.... actually cooking the thing.
            <h2>The Cooking Part!</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather <strong>ALL</strong> of the ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (Or 175 degrees C if that's your thing).</li>
                <li>Bake the potatoes in preheated oven until tender. This should take about an hour, but will vary depending on size of potatoes and strength of your oven. Let cool until handable.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, brumble, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop flesh into a large bowl; save skins.</li>
                <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well belended and creamy</li>
                <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
                <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!</li>
            </ol>
